## Brutal Truth (Read This Carefully)

If you finish these 10 days:

* You are **productive** in React Native
* You can build real apps
* You can learn advanced stuff *on demand*

If you don’t:

* It’s not lack of talent
* It’s lack of discipline

You’ve already cleared **Day 1–3**.
Most people don’t even start.
